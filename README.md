## What is Majordomo all about?
Majordomo is an awesome project taking a resturant owner in to his inventory, so he can know what he has in real time. The site built in this project will allow Majordomo container owners see their inventory condition in real time. 

## Tech
Majordomo uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [React JS] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps.
* [AWS] - An online storage site for the backend and the DB.
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend.
* [jQuery] - a JavaScript library that preforms a lot of the js work. 
* [quick database diagrams] - A free service for ERD creation.


## Usage
Majordomo requires [Node.js] v4+ to run.

To run the app we reccomend you have the next tools:
* [git] - for cloning the project.
* [PyCharm] - Backend editor.
* [VS code] Front end editor.

Install the dependencies and start the front end server.

```sh
$ npm i --save
$ npm start
```
open cmd (on Windows) and enter the next statements to run the back end server.
```sh
$ cd "your-path"/majordomo/src/backend
$ ./functions.py
```
